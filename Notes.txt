By Aleksandar Fotev,

Originaly a MikroElektronika project:

That shows an example how to write something on a TFT displey on a development board.


The example was modified to use: 

- Wifi Connection as input/output
- Buttons on the dev.board to change the mode of the board
- Buttons as input to apply actions / serve as input
- changed the way how the Wifi protocol works, but within the same storage limitation
- added a custom made debounce mechanism that ignores messages with the same ID (ignores reflections/rebounce of the WiFi signal)


List of modified files:
Transmitter.c,
ReadWrite_Routines.c
Misc_Routines.c


Description of modifications:

Transmitter.c:
Everything above except the WiFi protocol change

ReadWrote_Routines.c
WiFi protocol change, separation of the default value array into 2 arrays:
where one is used to contain signal value 
the other one is used to contain the signal ID value

Adjustment of the rest of the code to work as intended with the previous modification


Misc_Routines.c
Added a note that the default debounce routine/function does not work as intended in the provided library (that was provided by MikroElektronika).


The project (with my modifications) was tested by an assistent from Ra?unarski Fakultet (RAF) and evaluated as fully functional for the required assigment which was in short:

A transmiter/relay/reciever system that can send short and long signals via WiFi and represent the signl in a video and audio manner. 
For the video,the on-board TFT display was used, 
for audio, the on-board speaker system was used.
The board mode (transmiter/receiver/relay) was changed:
in real time via pressing of specific buttons on the board, 
with a visual cue via LED lamps switching on/off.
