By Aleksandar Fotev,

 This project is a simple demonstration of working with the BEE click board.
     The transmitter sends the data and the receiver displays it on the TFT.
     The on-board MRF24J40MA is a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio transceiver module
     and operates in the 2.4GHz frequency band.
     Detailed information about MRF24J40 module is availabe here:

The example was modified to use: 

- Buttons on the board to change the mode of the board
- Buttons as input to apply actions / serve as input
- changed the way how the Wifi protocol works, but within the same storage limitation
- added a custom made debounce mechanism that ignores messages with the same ID (ignores reflections/rebounce of the WiFi signal)


List of modified files:
Transmitter.c,
ReadWrite_Routines.c

Description of modifications:

Transmitter.c:
Everything above except the WiFi protocol change

ReadWrote_Routines.c
WiFi protocol change


Misc_Routines.c
Added a note that the default debounce routine/function does not work as intended in the provided library (that was provided by MikroElektronika)
